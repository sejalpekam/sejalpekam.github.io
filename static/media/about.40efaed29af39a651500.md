Hi, I’m Sejal – a _Software and Data Engineer_ with a passion for crafting impactful, user-centered solutions.

With a Master’s in Computer Science from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, I bring a strong foundation in software and data engineering, along with hands-on experience gained through my role at [AGCO Corporation](https://www.agcocorp.com/). My expertise spans **data engineering**, **full-stack development**, and **machine learning**, creating scalable solutions that deliver measurable results. As a Teaching Assistant for CS 101, I’ve honed my ability to communicate complex ideas effectively – a skill that complements my technical work.

**Why Connect with Me**: I’m analytical, results-oriented, and thrive in roles that require both creativity and precision. Whether building data pipelines, enhancing UI/UX, or automating processes, my contributions aim to drive impact and streamline experiences.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading 📚, photography 📷, and exploring new places 🌍, all of which fuel my curiosity and creativity. If you’re looking for a dynamic engineer with a holistic approach to problem-solving, let’s connect!
