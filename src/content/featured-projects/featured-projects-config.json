	   "description": "This project involved analyzing automated bug localization techniques using Randoop and EvoSuite across various open-source datasets, including Defects4J and BugSwarm. A precise bug localization method was developed to streamline the identification of faulty code segments, significantly reducing debugging time. Test cases were generated and key insights visualized to enhance software testing strategies, providing valuable recommendations for improving debugging processes in large-scale systems.",
